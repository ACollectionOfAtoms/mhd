We are currently working on getting everything up and running, but please take some time to read about what you can expect from this site.

Also, please take a few seconds to complete this 3 question [**survey**](https://surveynuts.com/surveys/take?id=161081&c=4300218393VPJR). The results will allow us to better cater to the community. 

# What is the Mental Health Directory (MHD)?

The MHD is a one-stop database that prioritizes accessibility, ease of use and humanity. The search engine provided by the directory will be a human-screened database allowing the user to find medical help, relatable blogs, legal services, self-help centers, and more, all in one convenient location.  

# Why is the MHD important?

Most mental health sites are daunting. They either have too much information, or too little. This resource runaround can be overwhelming and leave a person feeling alone, frustrated and trapped. This site hopes to eliminate the black hole of google searching for answers to mental health questions, providing you with a one-stop directory of mental health resources. Why should mental health be made any more daunting than it already is? It shouldn’t! The resources are out there, and we’re here to make them accessible to you.

# What can you expect from the MHD?

The MHD will be similar to a directory that you might visit to search for a new restaurant, or a reliable electrician. The directory will allow users to search for a variety of mental health resources in one convenient location. It will also provide helpful, user-submitted reviews and feedback to accompany many of the organizations, companies and agencies that are featured on the site. Here are just a few of the many resources that you can expect to find in the directory: 

* hospitals
* addiction centers
* housing advice
* legal services
* therapists and counselors
* help centers
* organizations 
* blogs and podcasts
* support groups

# How can you help?

Because the MHD is still in its initial stages, the creators are open to any feedback, help or encouragement that visitors may want to offer. This is a nonprofit site being created for everyday people, by everyday people. We appreciate anything that may make the site more beneficial to future users. This could be anything from content advice, something that you hope to see in the directory, or web design and development help. If you would like to offer your knowledge, or provide advice/feedback, please email us at: <mailto:questions@mentalhealthdirectory.net>

We look forward to serving you.

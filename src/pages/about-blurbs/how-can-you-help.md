Because the MHD is still in its initial stages, the creators are open to any feedback or help that visitors may want to contribute. We appreciate anything that may make the site more beneficial to future users. This could be anything from a similar site that has worked for you, something that you hope to see in the directory, or web design and development help. If you would like to offer your knowledge, or provide advice/feedback, please email us at:

title: 'What can you expect from the MHD? '
---
The directory will be similar to a directory that you might go to to search for a place to eat close by, or a good plumber in the area. The MHD will allow you to search for a variety of mental health resources in one convenient location. The directory will also provide helpful, user-submitted reviews and feedback to accompany many of the organizations, companies or hospitals that are listed. Here are just a few of the many resources that you can expect to find in the directory: 

* Hospitals
* addiction centers
* housing advice
* legal services
* therapists and counselors
* help centers
* organizations 
* Blogs and podcasts
